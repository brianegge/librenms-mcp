# LibreNMS MCP Server

LibreNMS MCP Server is a Python-based Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed to provide advanced, programmable access to LibreNMS network monitoring data and management features. It exposes a modern API for querying, automating, and integrating LibreNMS resources such as devices, ports, alerts, inventory, locations, logs, and more. The server supports both read and write operations, robust security features, and is suitable for integration with automation tools, dashboards, and custom network management workflows.

## Features

### Core Features

- Query LibreNMS devices, ports, inventory, locations, logs, and alerts with flexible filtering
- Retrieve network topology, device status, and performance metrics
- Access and analyze alert history, event logs, and system health
- Monitor interface statistics, port status, and traffic data
- Track endpoints and connected devices by MAC or IP address
- Retrieve and manage device groups, port groups, and poller groups
- Get detailed information about network services and routing

### Management Operations

- Create, update, and delete devices, ports, and groups (if enabled)
- Manage alert rules, notifications, and device metadata
- Configure read-only mode to restrict all write operations for safe monitoring
- Support for bulk operations on devices and ports

### Advanced Capabilities

- Rate limiting and API security features
- Real-time network monitoring and health tracking
- Comprehensive logging and audit trails
- SSL/TLS support and configurable timeouts
- Extensible with custom middlewares and utilities

## Security & Safety Features

### Read-Only Mode

The server supports a read-only mode that disables all write operations for safe monitoring:

```env
READ_ONLY_MODE=true
```

### Rate Limiting

The server supports rate limiting to control API usage and prevent abuse. If enabled, requests are limited per client using a sliding window algorithm.

Enable rate limiting by setting the following environment variables in your `.env` file:

```env
RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100   # Maximum requests allowed per window
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MINUTES=1   # Window size in minutes
```

If `RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED` is set to `true`, the server will apply rate limiting middleware. Adjust `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS` and `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MINUTES` as needed for your environment.

### SSL/TLS Configuration

The server supports SSL certificate verification and custom timeout settings:

```env
LIBRENMS_VERIFY_SSL=true    # Enable SSL certificate verification
LIBRENMS_TIMEOUT=30         # Connection timeout in seconds
```
